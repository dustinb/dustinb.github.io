Made it to the end of the beach where the nude beach is. At least that's what the weathered wooden sign 
said. Nobody was there, there never was. It wasn't that far away from civilization. Civilization being
 a strip of a dozen beach resorts.

The path was blocked by a rock wall jutting into the ocean a ways. Where the wall was in the ocean 
there was a break in the wall, a crevice or path to the other side. The parts of the wall that were 
once part of it scattered around the crevice. The tide was high and the waves were violent and crashing
 about those rock pieces. 2 Crows were perched on either side of the crevice (see painting). Didn't 
 seem like a gate that you wanted to go through but I came this far and hubris trumped humility. 
 Attempting to navigate through the gate and miss the waves proved to be too much, I would drown if I 
 continued. I don't recall if the crows stayed where they were. I was still triumphant and walked out 
 onto a rock in the ocean where my foot was pricked by some type of coral or animal, it stung. Time to 
 come down and head back head back. As soon as I started I noticed a Pelican in the distance flying 
 toward me. I stopped to watch, closer, closer, holy hit he's on target to pierce me, closer, fuck 
 this bird. About 10 feet in front the missile turns and heads along the beach.
