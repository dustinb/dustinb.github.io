A short history of vehicles driven/owned/repaired over the years with a lightbox popout.  See [here](/jekyll/lightbox)

# 1985 Bronco II

My Dad's vehicle I was allowed to drive if needed. Complete with CB radio you could breaker 1..9 and catch some
chat on citizens band.  Also used to haul the old Yar Craft 65 Horse tri hull to the lake for some skiiing.

# 1986 Ford Escort

My first purchased vehicle from a friend in high school.  Believe it was a 4 door.  The car lost it's life after
a radiator leak and the and the engine overheated. __picture is representation__

# 1999 Excelsior Henderson SuperX

Took my motorcycle test on this heavy beast.  Lot of good rides and memories from trips to MN, back roads of Wyoming
and Sound Dakota.  A solo San Diego to Colorado run.  It's for sale, contact me for details :)

# 1972 VW Dasher

This beauty of a vehicle was purchased with $400 added onto my already existing motorcycle loan.  That's how much
money I didn't have at the time.  The front wheel bearing was shot but it ran/drove just fine.  I forget what ended
the fun but I paid something like $125 for someone to take my $400 car away for parts.

# 1994 Chevy C1500 Silverado

Having hard time finding good picture so we have a 1978 Yamaha DT125 in the mix.  This was a great truck and still 
ran great when I sold it to upgrade to something with 4 wheel drive.

# 1972 Yamaha DS7

The picture not of the exact bike but is same year, color, and similar dent on the tank. This was a sweet ride, 2 stroke
twin engine, kick start only.  The bike was road worthy have a ood carb cleaning and fluids change.  Found a forever
how in summer of 2018.

# 1977 Yamaha XS750
This was a 1977 but came with a 1979? XS750 engine install and also another 1978 engine as a spare. Purchase price
was $500.  The engine in it has spun crank bearing (middle cylinder heat issue) but was able to repair the previous 
engine which had a bent valve.

# 1978 Yamaha XS750

A matching frame and engine # purchased in many boxes for $350.  It started out as a normal looking XS750 but with 
a cutting disk, welder and a bit of wiring it ended up as something else sometimes referred to as th Rat Monster.
This thread over at [www.yamaha-triples.org](http://www.yamaha-triples.org/forums/thread-view.asp?tid=16964&posts=33&start=1) 
shows what it started and ended as.

The transmission lost a couple teeth in 5th gear on the highway and put a hole in the case. It's now with a new
owner hopefully back on the road.
