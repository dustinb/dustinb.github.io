Show various vehicles owned/repaired/driven over the years with a lightbox popout.  See [here](/jekyll/lightbox) how I got 
lightbox working in Jekyll.  Some of these are real photos, some are representations as noted.


# 1985 Bronco II

My Dad's vehicle I was allowed to drive if needed. Complete with CB radio you could breaker 1..9 and catch some
chat on citizens band.  Also used to haul the old Yar Craft 65 Horse tri hull to the lake for some skiiing.

# 1972 VW Dasher

This beauty of a vehicle was purchased with $400 added onto my already existing motorcycle loan.  That's how much
money I didn't have at the time.  The front wheel bearing was shot but it ran/drove just fine.  I forget what ended
the fun but I paid something like $125 for someone to take my $400 car away for parts.

# 1972 Yamaha DS7

twin engine, kick start only.  The bike was road worthy have a ood carb cleaning and fluids change.  Found a forever
how in summer of 2018.

# 1977 Yamaha XS750
This was a 1977 but came with a 1979? XS750 engine install and also another 1978 engine as a spare. Purchase price
was $500.  The engine in it has spun crank bearing (middle cylinder heat issue) but was able to repair the previous 
engine which had a bent valve.

# 1978 Yamaha XS750

A matching frame and engine # purchased in many boxes for $350.  It started out as a normal looking XS750 but with 
a cutting disk, welder and a bit of wiring it ended up as something else sometimes referred to as th Rat Monster.
This thread over at [www.yamaha-triples.org](http://www.yamaha-triples.org/forums/thread-view.asp?tid=16964&posts=33&start=1) 
shows what it started and ended as.

The transmission lost a couple teeth in 5th gear on the highway and put a hole in the case. It's now with a new
owner hopefully back on the road.
