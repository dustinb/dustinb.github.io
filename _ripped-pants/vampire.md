I was at the pool bar when the vampire drugged me.

It was morning and only a handful of people sitting around the circular bar. Wonder if they were having real 
drinks this early. I was definitely hung over and asking for glasses of water on repeat. I'm sure I had 13 of them.

I can't recall what the vampire ordered. To be sure he and the bartender could have been in on it together and he 
whispered something to him that wasn't an order. What is for sure is that when he showed his teeth to me it was with
 purpose. I stared at the fang long enough for the vampire or bartender to drug my 15th water.

The vampire walked away looking right at me. I'm sure it wasn't because I was still staring even though his mouth was 
closed. It was a bold move, if your going to fake an order at least walk away with a drink or empty glass.

After all that water I felt not much better than when I woke up. But at least my mouth wasn't dry and I don't want to 
end my morning beach walk streak..
