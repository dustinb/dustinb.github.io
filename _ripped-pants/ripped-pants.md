After the Mexican fisherman dropped me off on the beach I stood there dumbfounded.

My pants were ripped and like a 
dog staring at his shit in the living room I knew I did something wrong. Only I wasn't sure what it was but I was sure
everyone else knew. Unlike a dog I may never figure it out.

The beach chairs, pool bar, pool area were all empty. I could see the hotel room windows and the all inclusive 
breakfast window facade. Most definitely people eating in there and waking up to start there day looking at the 
lone person standing in the water.

My sandals were gone? but somehow I still had my glasses. My pants were definitely not going to be mended. Even if I
 could would I want to wear these clothes ever again? The yellow linen shirt seemed to be in good shape.

I never gave that fisherman money for his gas. I said I would drop it off at the office before I left but I didn't. 
I don't know where that money is, seemed to be a lot of pesos, but I can't recall the exact amount. I hung onto it 
for many years, even writing an email to the resort to see if they could help me locate and pay the man. They didn't 
reply, I didn't press it too much.

When they questioned me about the night before I couldn't really tell them much. I did suggest I was possibly 
drugged at the pool bar. I left out the part that he was a vampire. There were 3 other possibilities. One: alcohol 
poisoning. Two: the urchin or whatever was growing on that rock that pricked my foot. Three the shaman who slapped my 
back pretending he wanted to sell me marijuana. Any one of these is enough to send someone on a journey to hell and back.
